# Understanding Machine Learning
## 1. Overview:
- What machine learning is?
- Machine learning process
- Basic concepts & terminology

## 2. What is machine learning?
<p>What machine learning does?</p>
- Finds patterns in data
- Uses those patterns to predict the future
- Examples:
	- Detecting credit card fraud
	- Determining whether a customer is likely to switch to a competitor
	- Deciding when to do preventive maintenance on a factory robot
<p>What does it mean to learn?</p>
<p>How did you learn to read?</p>
<p>Learning requires:</p>
- Identifying patterns
- Recognizing those patterns when you see them again
<P>This is what machine learning does</P>

## 3. Machine learning in a nutshell
- Data: contains pattern
-> Feed data into a machine learning algorithm
- Machine learning algorithm: finds patterns
-> The algorithm generates something called a model
- Model: recognizes patterns
-> Application supplies data to the model
- Application: Supplies new data to see if it matches known pattern

## 4. Why is machine learning is so hot right now?
<p>Doing machine learning requires:</p>
- Lots of data: (Big data)
- Lots of computer power: (Cloud computing)
- Effective machine learning algorithms
<p>=> All of those things are now more available than ever</p>

## 5. Who's interested in Machine learning?
1. Business leaders: want solutions to bussiness problems
2. Software developers: want to create better applications
3. Data scientists: want to powerful, easy-to-use tools

## 6. The ethics of Machine learning?
- What if the data is biased?
- How can you explain a model's decision?

## 7. The main points
- Machine learning lets us find patterns in existing data, then create and use a model that recognizes those patterns in new data
- Machine learning has gone mainstream
	- Although it raises ethical concerns
- Machine learning can probably help your organization

## 8. The machine leaning process
<p>Iterative: In both big and small ways</p>
<p>Challenging: It's rarely easy</p>
<p>Often rewarding: But not always</p>

## 9. The first problem: asking the right question
<p>Choosing what question to ask is the most important of the process</p>
<p>Ask yourself: do you have the right data to answer this question?</p>
<p>Ask yourself: do you know how you'll measure success?</p>
